Gettysburg College, Spring 2014, CS391: User Interface Design and Implementation, Final Project. 


  SoapGenius is an Android app geared towards novice to expert soap makers. The goal of the ap is for soapers to create soap recipes including calculating the exact amount of lye (NaOH for solid soap and KOH for liquid soap), liquid, and extra ingredients (essential oil, powders, etc.) for the recipes. The user interface will enable users to easily play with different oils and butters and learn about the expected 'qualities' (in hardness, conditioning, bubbly, creamy, and cleansing aspects) of the recipe. The end goal is for this app to be free on the Android Store.
